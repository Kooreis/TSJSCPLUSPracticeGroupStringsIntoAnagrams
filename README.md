# Question: How can you group an array of strings into anagrams? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a solution to the problem of grouping an array of strings into anagrams. The function 'groupAnagrams' takes an array of strings as an input. It then creates a new Map object, which will be used to store the strings grouped by their sorted characters. The function iterates over each string in the input array, sorts the characters in the string, and joins them back together. This sorted string is used as a key in the map. If the map does not already contain this key, an empty array is set for this key. The original string is then pushed into the array corresponding to this key. This process groups all anagrams together, as anagrams will have the same sorted string. Finally, the function returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains strings that are anagrams of each other. The console.log statement at the end of the code calls the function with a test array of strings and logs the result.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript solution solves the problem in a similar way to the JavaScript solution. Both solutions use a map-like structure (a JavaScript Map in the JavaScript solution and a plain object in the TypeScript solution) to group the strings by their sorted characters. Both solutions then return the values of the map-like structure, which are the groups of anagrams.

The main difference between the two solutions is that the TypeScript solution is written in a more object-oriented style, with a class and methods, while the JavaScript solution is written in a more functional style, with a standalone function. This difference is more about style and personal preference than about the capabilities of the two languages.

Another difference is that the TypeScript solution uses static methods, which are methods that are called on the class itself, not on instances of the class. This is a feature of TypeScript (and modern versions of JavaScript) that is not used in the JavaScript solution.

Finally, the TypeScript solution uses type annotations to specify the types of the parameters and return values of the methods. This is a feature of TypeScript that is not available in JavaScript. The type annotations can help catch errors at compile time, before the code is run. For example, if you tried to call the `groupAnagrams` method with a number instead of an array of strings, TypeScript would give you an error.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution follows the same logic as the JavaScript version. It also uses a map to store the sorted characters of each string as keys and the strings themselves as values. The sorted characters of each string are used as keys because anagrams will have the same characters when sorted. The strings are then grouped by these keys. The result is a vector of vectors, where each sub-vector contains strings that are anagrams of each other.

However, there are some differences due to the language features and methods used in each version:

1. Data Structures: JavaScript uses the built-in Map and Array objects, while C++ uses the std::map and std::vector from the Standard Template Library (STL).

2. Looping: JavaScript uses the for...of loop to iterate over arrays and maps, while C++ uses range-based for loops.

3. Sorting: JavaScript uses the Array.prototype.sort method to sort the characters in a string, while C++ uses the std::sort function from the STL.

4. String Manipulation: JavaScript uses the Array.from, Array.prototype.join, and String.prototype.push methods to manipulate strings and arrays, while C++ uses the std::string::begin, std::string::end, and std::vector::push_back methods.

5. Output: JavaScript logs output to the console using console.log, while C++ uses std::cout to print to the standard output.

6. Function Declaration: JavaScript uses the function keyword to declare a function, while C++ uses the type of the return value (in this case, std::vector<std::vector<std::string>>) to declare a function.

7. Main Function: In C++, the main function is the entry point of the program. JavaScript doesn't have a main function; instead, the script is executed from top to bottom.
